This directory contains modified code from Maplab's `message_flow` package. The original code can be found at:  
[https://github.com/ethz-asl/maplab/tree/master/common/message-flow](https://github.com/ethz-asl/maplab/tree/master/common/message-flow).

The original namespace `message_flow` has been renamed to `sk4slam_msgflow` to prevent naming conflicts in projects using both Maplab and sk4slam.
